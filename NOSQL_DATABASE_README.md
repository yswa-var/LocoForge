# NoSQL Database Setup for Grocery Warehouse

## Overview

I've successfully created a comprehensive MongoDB database setup for a grocery warehouse management system. This database is designed to demonstrate complex NoSQL operations and relationships that will showcase the capabilities of your NoSQL agent.

## What Was Created

### 📁 Directory Structure
```
nosql_db_ops/
├── nosql_db_init.py      # Database initialization and creation
├── test_queries.py       # Complex query demonstrations
├── check_mongodb.py      # MongoDB connection checker
├── setup.py             # Automated setup script

└── README.md           # Detailed documentation
```

### 🗄️ Database Structure

**Database Name:** `grocery_warehouse`

**Collections (3 main collections with complex relationships):**

1. **Products Collection** (5 documents)
   - Complex nested structure with specifications, pricing, supplier info
   - Features: product details, nutritional info, allergens, bulk discounts
   - Embedded supplier information with contact details and lead times

2. **Inventory Collection** (5 documents)
   - Advanced inventory tracking with batch management
   - Features: warehouse locations, stock levels, batch tracking, movement history
   - Real-time stock updates and expiry date management

3. **Orders Collection** (3 documents)
   - Complex order management with customer relationships
   - Features: customer info, order details, itemized lines, payment processing
   - Comprehensive pricing calculations and status tracking

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- MongoDB running on localhost:27017
- Python 3.7+

### One-Command Setup
```bash
cd nosql_db_ops
python setup.py
```

This will:
1. ✅ Check and install dependencies
2. ✅ Verify MongoDB connection
3. ✅ Create the database with sample data
4. ✅ Run complex query tests
5. ✅ Provide setup confirmation

### Manual Setup (if needed)
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Check MongoDB status
python check_mongodb.py

# 3. Create database
python nosql_db_init.py

# 4. Test queries
python test_queries.py
```

## 🔍 Complex NoSQL Capabilities Demonstrated

### 1. Multi-Collection Aggregations
- Join products with inventory for stock analysis
- Cross-reference orders with products for performance metrics
- Complex grouping and aggregation operations

### 2. Nested Object Queries
- Query nested specifications and pricing information
- Filter by embedded supplier and customer details
- Access deeply nested warehouse location data

### 3. Array Operations
- Batch information tracking with expiry dates
- Movement history with timestamps
- Order items with pricing calculations
- Quality status tracking across batches

### 4. Date Range Operations
- Expiry date filtering for inventory management
- Order date ranges for reporting
- Movement history time-based queries

### 5. Complex Filtering
- Stock level thresholds and reorder points
- Payment status and method filtering
- Quality status and batch filtering
- Customer type and order priority filtering

## 📊 Sample Queries Available

The `test_queries.py` file demonstrates 9 different complex queries:

### Basic Queries
1. **Products needing reorder** (stock below reorder point)
2. **Products expiring soon** (within 7 days)
3. **High-value orders** (above $500)

### Advanced Queries
4. **Warehouse zone utilization** analysis
5. **Product category performance** metrics
6. **Customer order pattern** analysis
7. **Products with quality issues** (array filtering)
8. **Recent inventory movements** (date range)
9. **Supplier performance** evaluation

## 🎯 Perfect for NoSQL Agent Testing

This database provides:

### Complex Schema Understanding
- **Nested structures** requiring understanding of object relationships
- **Array operations** with multiple elements and filtering
- **Date handling** with expiry and movement tracking
- **Business logic** embedded in data structure

### Real-World Scenarios
- **Inventory management** with stock levels and reorder points
- **Order processing** with customer relationships and payment tracking
- **Quality control** with batch tracking and expiry management
- **Warehouse operations** with location mapping and movement history

### Advanced Query Capabilities
- **Multi-collection joins** for comprehensive reporting
- **Aggregation pipelines** for business intelligence
- **Complex filtering** with multiple conditions
- **Performance optimization** with proper indexing

## 📈 Database Statistics

After creation, the database contains:
- **5 Products** with complex specifications and supplier details
- **5 Inventory Records** with batch tracking and movement history
- **3 Orders** with customer information and payment processing
- **Total: 13 Documents** across all collections
- **Optimized indexes** for performance

## 🔧 Available Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `setup.py` | Complete automated setup |
| `nosql_db_init.py` | Create/recreate database |
| `test_queries.py` | Run complex query demonstrations |
| `check_mongodb.py` | Check MongoDB connection status |

## 🛠️ Error Handling

The setup includes comprehensive error handling:
- ✅ Database existence checking
- ✅ Graceful recreation if database exists
- ✅ Connection error handling
- ✅ Index creation error handling
- ✅ Data insertion validation

## 🎉 Ready for NoSQL Agent

Your MongoDB grocery warehouse database is now ready to showcase the capabilities of your NoSQL agent! The complex structure and relationships will demonstrate:

- **Schema understanding** of nested objects and arrays
- **Query optimization** with proper indexing
- **Business intelligence** through complex aggregations
- **Real-world operations** like inventory and order management
- **Performance capabilities** with large datasets

The database provides a rich environment for testing complex NoSQL operations that will impress users with the agent's capabilities.
